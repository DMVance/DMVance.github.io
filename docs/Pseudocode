Daily Quotes
    Database of quotes that can be continually expanded (MongoDB?)
    Simple dictionary
    Randomly select a quote.
    Display for 24 hours.
    Remove quote from random selection until all quotes have been used.
    Return all quotes to random selector to start over.
    Quote should be unavailable for same number of days as there are quotes, so it is a rolling period.
